## 1. Project Nature

VietFuelAPI is a **non-profit, community-driven project** built and maintained by volunteer developers. It has no official affiliation with Petrolimex, PVOil, Mipec, the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT), or any Vietnamese government agency.

## 2. Data Accuracy Limitations

Data provided by VietFuelAPI is automatically aggregated from **11 public sources**. While we strive for accuracy, we **cannot guarantee**:

- **Absolute accuracy**: Data may deviate due to scraping errors or source website structural changes.
- **Completeness**: Some price adjustment cycles may be reflected with a delay (up to ~15 minutes on Thursdays, up to 6 hours on other days).
- **Continuity**: The service may be disrupted if a source implements blocking measures or restructures its data.

When a source fails, the API serves **Stale Cache** and clearly marks it with `"isStale": true` in the JSON response.

- Financial and investment decisions
- Commercial and business decisions

## 4. Data Collection Method

VietFuelAPI collects data through:

- **Transparent Bot User-Agent**: `VietFuelBot/1.0 (Community non-profit; +https://github.com/TranQui004/vietfuel-api)` — allows source administrators to identify and contact us.
- **Reasonable frequency**: Adaptive schedule aligned with Decree 80/2023/ND-CP (maximum every 15 minutes on Thursdays, every 4–6 hours on other days).
- **No long-term storage**: Cache data is retained for a maximum of 60 minutes and refreshed periodically — no long-term history is stored.

All trade names, logos, and trademarks appearing in this project (Petrolimex, PVOil, Mipec, COMECO, Saigon Petro, etc.) are **property of their respective owners**. VietFuelAPI uses these names solely for source attribution and makes no claim of ownership or commercial affiliation.
